# SPM fMRI Analysis Pipeline: Preprocessing to 2nd-Level

This repository contains custom MATLAB and SPM (Statistical Parametric Mapping) batch scripts for functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data analysis. 

## Overview
The scripts cover a complete fMRI data processing pipeline, including:
* **Preprocessing:** (e.g., Slice timing, Realignment, Coregistration, Normalization, Smoothing)
* **1st-Level Analysis:** General Linear Model (GLM) specification and estimation for individual subjects.
* **2nd-Level Analysis:** Group-level statistical analysis.

## Access & Usage Policy (Please Read)
These scripts are currently actively maintained and highly customized for specific research datasets. Therefore, this repository serves primarily as my personal code backup and academic portfolio.

**All rights are reserved.** If you are interested in viewing, referencing, or adapting these batch scripts for your own research, **you must contact me directly for confirmation and permission first.** *Please do not copy, distribute, or run these scripts without prior communication.*
